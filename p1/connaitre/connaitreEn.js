  <h1>Meet Cherif Benhabiles </h1>  
<h2 style={{color:"green"}}>General Director of CNMA  </h2>
<div style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>
<strong>President of the African Insurance Organisation AIO</strong>
<span>M. Cherif BENHABILES,</span> , who after a long career rich in achievements, during which he was able to acquire a great experience in the field of Insurance, today holds the position of Managing Director of the CNMA, a prestigious institution centenary which offers insurance coverage for all branches, which he has been able to manage effectively thanks to the strategy he has adopted.
<br/><br/>
It can be said that  <span> M. Cherif BENHABILES </span>has fully contributed to the development of the Insurance sector, in particular Agricultural Insurance, and that the CNMA is requested by many countries to share its experience and contribute to the development of Agricultural Insurance.
<br/><br/>
<span>The general manager of the CNMA </span>also intervenes as an expert in certain countries that request his experience. Something that honors Algeria, which can position itself as one of the leaders, in Arab and African countries, in terms of Agricultural Insurance.

<br/><br/>
Furthermore, during the 48th session of the General Assembly of the African Insurance Organization, held in Nairobi, Kenya, in June 2022, Mr. Cherif BENHABILES was elected Vice-President of the AIO and President of the local organizing committee of the 49th session of the AIO General Assembly, to be held in Algiers in May 2023, which is considered an advantage for Algeria, that aspires to occupy a decision-maker place in the African space.<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
On the other hand, this represents also an achievement for the CNMA, which consolidates its presence at the local level and imposes itself at the continental level.
